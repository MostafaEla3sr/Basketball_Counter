This is a simple basketball counter app developed using Flutter. The app allows users to keep track of the scores for two basketball teams (Team A and Team B) with buttons to score 1, 2, or 3 points for each team. Additionally, there are buttons to display the result, showing a dialog indicating the winning team or declaring a draw, and a reset button to reset the scores.
